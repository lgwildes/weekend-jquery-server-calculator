## Description

This project is a digital calculator. I isolated each type of mathetmatical operator by assigning each button its own id. Then depending on which id was clicked, that calls a function which will then send the client's equation information to the server. Next, the server runs the calculation based on the operator which is used, and returns and saves the correct result as well as the entire equation itself. The server sends this back to the client and appends the result to the DOM. On page load, the DOM also loads all previous equations which have been saved until the server is restarted.
